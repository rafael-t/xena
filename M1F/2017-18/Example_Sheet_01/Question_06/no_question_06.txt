It's impossible to formulate Question 6 in Lean, as far as I know.
Lean uses mathematical foundations which only allow you to make sets of
things all of which have the same type. So for example if A is a set
and 1 is in A, then all the other elements of A have to be numbers too.
This does not cause a problem when doing normal mathematics, but it
does mean that the (rather pathological) question 6 cannot be formulated
within Lean.
